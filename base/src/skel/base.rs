/// This example further defines traits for specific [Provider] implementation. The
/// trait extensions are said to be `base` because these trait extensions will be implemented
/// in the [foundation] and [platform] with a matching [ProviderKind].
///
/// The `base` implementation pattern only makes sense if you understand different jobs
/// that [Platform] and [Foundation] fulfil. To put it simply: [Platform] enables `utilization` of
/// services and resources that are not native to `Starlane` and the [Foundation] enables
/// `creation` and `management` of those same external services or resources.
///
/// So for example the [Platform] [config::ProviderConfig] implementation for
/// [ProviderKind::PostgresService] holds the postgres connection pool config
/// including: hostname, port and credentials.  And the [DockerDaemonFoundation] [ProviderConfig]
/// implementation for [ProviderKind::PostgresService] requires the same connection pool
/// info because the [DockerDaemonFoundation]'s Postgres [Provider] implementation needs
/// to provision using the credentials that the [Platform] expects.

/// ## !Foundation implementation required!
/// For a new [Provider] to work it will also need a concrete implementation for one or more
/// [Foundation](crate::Foundation)s. See foundation starter template: [`skel`](crate::base::foundation::skel)

/// being defined yet lacking specific definitions that any particular [foundation::Foundation]
